no valid credentials source found to configure the AWS provider.
Consider supplying the required AWS credentials to the provider either via environment variables,
or by configuring the provider explicitly in the Pulumi program with an explicit provider resource.
See https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-terraform-module?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-terraform-providers.
Alternatively, you can use Pulumi ESC to set up dynamic credentials with AWS OIDC.
